# Welcome To Sonic's Stadium!
Welcome to the GitHub page for Project Sonic Stadium! Sonic would like to introduce you to his brand new collection, Now in Minecraft!

# Don't know what Sonic Stadium is? No problem!
  Sonic Stadium is a project that tries to bring the Classic Sonic Games into the Minecraft Java Edition. This project has alot of work and care being put
into it. 

# What does this map contain?
This map will feature custom models, custom entities, everything that was introduced into the Classic Games such as Spindashing, Checkpoints, Save Files, Gamemodes, and many more!

# History of Sonic Stadium
In 2019, Sonic Stadium started development on the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft with the title of Classic Sonic Trilogy and a demo was released that included the first 2 acts of Green Hill Zone but showed little to no creativity.
As time went on, I ended the project because of the little to no coding/command block knowledge. I kept restarting the project trying to find the perfect ideas that I could go on. The project would go on for years until recently when I started learning how to mod Minecraft.
Now as of 2023, I finally have the proper knowledge and creativity to finally go ahead and start development for the final time and finish this masterpiece.

# What Classic Games does this map include?
This project will contain Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3&K, and Sonic CD. There are no plans to add any more games but it could happen!

# When will Sonic Stadium be released to the public?
I have no clue as of 5/19/23. However I do know that the map will be split into many different versions with Prototype Builds being released as well. The Proto builds will be just showing what is done with the project with no real polish being added to it. There would real issues with Proto builds as you could imagine but I'm not going out of my way to make sure that the prototype builds will stop at a point. Demo builds will be like Proto builds but there will be some changes from the final versions that only allow the player to enter some levels and many things already unlocked. Demo builds are meant to show what the final version pretty much looks like while only including a few things that are actually finished. The final build is the last version that will be worked on unless there are some bugs that need to be fixed but thats pretty much it.

# When will we see the first prototype build?
My only answer to that is probably within the next few months. I'm currently in the prosess of working on the mod but the mod's development will be seprate from the world's development. I need to make sure that things are done before I can really even start working on the world as it DOES exist right now but the world is empty. The assets for GHZ are already done and I just have a few things that I need to work on but then I can start working on other things. The first prototype will hopefully include a Test Zone and the first act of GHZ.
