# Welcome To Sonic's Stadium!
Welcome to the GitHub page for Project Sonic Stadium! Sonic would like to introduce you to his brand new collection, Now in Minecraft!

# Don't know what Sonic Stadium is? No problem!
  Sonic Stadium is a project that tries to bring the Classic Sonic Games into the Minecraft Java Edition. This project has alot of work and care being put
into it. 

# What does this map contain?
This map will feature custom models, custom entities, everything that was introduced into the Classic Games such as Spindashing, Checkpoints, Save Files, Gamemodes, and many more!

# History of Sonic Stadium
In 2019, Sonic Stadium started development on the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft with the title of Classic Sonic Trilogy and a demo was released that included the first 2 acts of Green Hill Zone but showed little to no creativity.
As time went on, I ended the project because of the little to no coding/command block knowledge. I kept restarting the project trying to find the perfect ideas that I could go on. The project would go on for years until recently when I started learning how to mod Minecraft.
Now as of 2023, I finally have the proper knowledge and creativity to finally go ahead and start development for the final time and finish this masterpiece.

# What Classic Games does this map include?
This project will contain Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3&K, and Sonic CD. There are no plans to add any more games but it could happen!
